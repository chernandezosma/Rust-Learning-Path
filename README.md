# Rust Learning Path

This repository is nothing more than a *Logbook* of a self-taught Rust student.

All comments expressed in the repository and its directories have been made to record the difficulties or complications encountered.

The Path is based on the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and considering it as the best learning foundation.

## Hello World
This chapter simply checks that everything is correctly installed and displays the well-known "Hello World!" message.
